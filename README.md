I made a simple but complete version of this game. The interesting point was that pawn was relatively the most difficult part of implementing the game, because two of the three special moves of the game were related to the pawn, and the pawn's movement and capture were different from the other pieces, so the pawn needed a few more conditions to be able to simulate checkmate.
